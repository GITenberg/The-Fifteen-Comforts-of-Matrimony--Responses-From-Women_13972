be scans of photocopies of a reproduction of the original text. On top
of the original's battered type-face and archaic spellings, this
preparer, and the proofreaders before him, have had to contend with
dirty or faded images and missing margins. We have made our best
guesses as to the missing letters, but in some cases we were stymied;
those few places are marked with [*?]. In addition, the most obvious
printer's mistakes (transposed, missing, obviously incorrect, and even
upside-down letters) have been corrected.]<br /><br /></p>

<h2>The PREFACE.</h2>

<p><i>Indeed we the Ladies of Pleasures, and those that stile themselves
Procurers in Love Affairs, highly resent the late Paper put out
against our Profession and bespattering of us for using only our own;
but since it is the Way of the World for most Men to be inclinable to
love Lac'd Mutton, I think it is their Duty to resent the Affront with
us so much, as to Satyrize the Author of the</i> Fifteen Comforts of
Whoring, <i>who without is some young bashful Effeminate Fool or
another, that knows not how to say</i> Boh to a Goose; <i>or some old
suffocated old Wretch so far pass'd his Labour, that he scolds for
Madness that he cannot give a buxom young Lass her Benevolence; or
else he may an hundred to one be one of Captain</i> Risby's <i>Fraternity,
and so must needs be a Woman Hater by Course. But let him be what he
will, so long as our Impudence is Case-harden'd we value not his
Reflections, and therefore will not leave our Vocation tho' Claps and
Poxes shou'd be our Portion every Day for according to an eminent
Whore now Deceas'd,</i></p>

<p class="poem">Clap, clap ye Whores, Clap as Clap can,<br />
Some Clap to Women, we'll Clap the Men.<br /><br /></p>

<tr><td><h3><i>The first Comfort of Whoring, Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>No sooner does a Maid arrive to Years,<br />
And she the Pleasures of Conjunction hears,<br />
But strait her Maidenhead a Tip-toe runs,<br />
To get her like, in Daughters or in Sons;<br />
Upon some jolly Lad she casts her Eye,<br />
And with some am'rous Gestures by the by;<br />
She gives him great Encouragement to take<br />
His fill of Love, and swears that for his sake<br />
She soon shall Die; which makes the Youth so hot<br />
To get about the Maiden's Honey-pot,<br />
That promising her Marriage and the like,<br />
They both a Bargain very quickly Strike;<br />
[*?] Rubbers often take till she does prove<br />
With Child, then she bids adieu to Love;<br />
And e're she's brought to Bed away does Creep,<br />
For fear he should the Wenche's Urchin keep.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Second Comfort of Whoring, Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>Now when a Maid has crackt her Maidenhead,<br />
By being once or twice (Sir) brought to Bed,<br />
Her Credit then's so broke that all her Wit,<br />
And Policy cannot a Husband get;<br />
But yet not being out of Heart she Cries,<br />
From Marriage keeping I shall be more wise,<br />
For if he's not a Fool he soon will find,<br />
I had before I'd him to some been kind,<br />
Then how he'd call me arrant Bitch and Whore,<br />
And Swear some Stallion had been there before;<br />
Then leave me, Wherefore I will single Live,<br />
And my Invention to decoying give,<br />
For as I was by fickle Man betray'd,<br />
So Men by me too shall be Bubbles made,<br />
Till the dull Sots clandestine Means do take,<br />
In robbing Masters,for a Strumpets sake,<br />
For which if they shou'd at the Gallows Swing,<br />
Their End I'd in some merry Ditty Sing.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i> The Third Comfort of whoring answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>What tho' of Whoring it is the mishap,<br />
Sometimes for him that Ruts to get a Clap,<br />
Or an Invetrate Pox which may expose<br />
His private Sports by Eating off his Nose;<br />
How many by hard Drinking will Roar out<br />
With Aches, Rheumatism's or the Gout,<br />
When in that gorging, guzling, tipling Sin<br />
There is not half the Pleasure, that there's in,<br />
The soft Embraces of a Woman who<br />
Altho' she is not to one Moral true,<br />
Does strive to please your height of amorous Lust,<br />
With such a ravishing and pleasing Gust,<br />
That wou'd an Eunuch tempt to tast the same,<br />
But that he Tools does want to play the Game.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The fourth Comfort of Whoring answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>Tho' Buboes, Nodes and Ulcers are the Marks,<br />
Of many a wanton Beau and am'rous Sparks<br />
And many a lustful Lecher oft complains<br />
Of restless Days and damn'd nocturnal Pains,<br />
Nays go into a Flux o dozen Weeks,<br />
Is't not the Man himself these Sorrow seeks?<br />
Besides, how often see you go astride<br />
A Miss, as if she was with Packthread ty'd;<br />
Who's Poxt and Clapt as much as you can be,<br />
And undergoes a deal of Misery,<br />
To give your wanton Appetites content,<br />
[*?] feeding you with Flesh, altho' in Lent:<br />
Therefore as the old Woman very Tart<br />
Once said, when against Thunder she did Fart,<br />
'Twas only tit for tat, so if the Men<br />
Do clap the Whores, and Whores Claps them agen,<br />
Tis only tit for tat; tis very true,<br />
What's good for Goose is good for Gander too.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The fifth Comfort of Whoring answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>What if a Man is in a marry'd State?<br />
Confin'd to one does am'rous Heat abate,<br />
Or shew me him (altho' he were in need.)<br />
That always wou'd upon one Diet feed<br />
When once a Woman's by a Man enjoy'd<br />
For good and all, his Appetite is cloy'd.<br />
Therefore he fixes on some wanton Miss<br />
Whom rather than his Wife behalf he'd Kiss,<br />
For as it's oft reported now a days,<br />
A Thing that's fresh, fresh Courage, too will raise<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Sixth Comfort of Whoring, Answer'd</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>What Man wou'd shun the Plagues of Pox and Pills,<br />
Or all the ails that are in Doctors Bills,<br />
Rather than not be circled in the Arms<br />
Of one that tempts you with a thousand Charms,<br />
And tho' she long has lost her Maidenhead,<br />
Yet such Dexterity she'll shew in Bed,<br />
That, Sir, your Mouth wou'd water o're and o're,<br />
To feed again upon a skilful Whore.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The seventh Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>'Tis true, the Fop that thinketh to secure'd<br />
To himself, in private Lodgins some fine Whore<br />
He is a Fool, for she'll not be confin'd,<br />
To any Man altho' he's are so kind;<br />
For being then high Pampered and Fed,<br />
In absence of her Cull she takes to Bed<br />
Another, that with Gold allures her too,<br />
That she may not to her Gallant be true;<br />
For thinks she, when her Chap is tir'd quite,<br />
And turns her off in others to delight,<br />
From all she can she'll privately receive,<br />
Which may her great Necessities relieve,<br />
When that she bids adieu her Master's Bed,<br />
To get by publick jilting Tricks her Bread.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The eighth Comfort of Whoring, Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>If any Man's in Love with any Whore,<br />
Why ought he not to lavish all his Store<br />
Upon her? Since, to make the Fop admire,<br />
Those prety Features which sets him a fire,<br />
She's often at the Charge of Velvit Hoods,<br />
Silk Stockins, Velvit Scarves and other Goods,<br />
Lac'd Shoes, rich Mantoe's, Gloves and Diamond Rings<br />
Fine Linnen, Gowns, and other costly things.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The ninth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>If any has a Jilt some time sustain'd,<br />
Who has imperious o're his Pocket reign'd,<br />
And he's grown weary of so sweet a Life,<br />
Or else being jealous takes to him a Wife;<br />
The Whore can do no less than fling and tear,<br />
And on th' inconstant Coxcomb Vengeance swaer,<br />
For leaving her in this her state of Sin;<br />
And let the World know what the Spark has been,<br />
Unless a Pension he to her allows,<br />
That she may not his Roguery disclose.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The tenth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>T'is true we Harlots work by various means,<br />
And act our Parts behind too diff'rent Scenes;<br />
Sometimes we do a Bastard lay to those,<br />
That never did so much as touch our Cloaths;<br />
Perhaps too ne'er were in our Company,<br />
So Guineas get by this same Subtilty;<br />
And many times a Pocket too we pick,<br />
For at no mischief will a Strumpit stick;<br />
For once a Woman's bad, there's no relief<br />
By being only Whore, but also Thief.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Eleventh Comfort of Whoring, Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>We'll have you know, of Whores are very few,<br />
That will to any Man be ever true;<br />
To us all Men for Money are alike,<br />
With Skips as soon as Beaus we bargains strike;<br />
And gad no sooner is a Cully gone,<br />
But quick another in his Room gets on.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Twelfth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>Besides great Charges we are at for Cloaths,<br />
To tempt the Fancies of our cringing Beaus,<br />
We Pimps and Bullies keep to be our Bail,<br />
When Sharping Bailiffs nabb us for a Jayl.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Thirteenth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>Again as we to <i>Bridewel</i> oft are sent,<br />
To undergo a flauging Punishment,<br />
A bribe to him that Whips us then is gi'n,<br />
To have Compassion to our tender Skin.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Fourteenth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>With pretty winning ways we do assure,<br />
Our selves to bring the Woodcocks to our Lure<br />
As ogling wishfully, and having Tongue,<br />
Which tho' 'tis false, yet with good Language hung<br />
And if we have a Voice that's good, we sing<br />
And <i>Syren</i> like our Fops to ruin bring;<br />
Then how we Strumpets do rejoyce to see,<br />
The wiser Sex undone by Lechery.<br /><br /></td></tr>


<tr><td><h3><i>The Fifteenth Comfort of Whoring Answer'd.</i></h3></td></tr>

<tr><td>But now good lack-a-day our Trade's so bad,<br />
That truly Customers can scarce be had,<br />
Through those sly Whore's that do in privat dwell,<br />
So (but a story sad it is to tell)<br />
Our common Whores can scarce their Livings get<br />
By all the means of an intrieguing Wit.<br />
For <i>Drury Lane</i>, in <i>Fleetstreet</i> or the <i>Strand</i>,<br />
Hours we walk e're any by the Hand,<br />
Will take us, wherefore as we daggle home,<br />
Some prick-louse <i>Taylor</i> strutting up will come,<br />
With whom for want we're forced to comply,<br />
for one poor two pence wet, and two pence dry.<br /><br /></td></tr>

But I a Virgin cannot take my Rest;<br />
I'm discontented up, as bad a Bed,<br />
Because I'm plagued with my Maiden-head;<br />
A thing that do's my blooming Years no good,<br />
But only serves to freeze my youthful Blood,<br />
Which slowly Circulates, do what I can,<br />
For want of Bleeding by some skilful Man;<br />
Whose tender hand his <i>Launcet</i> so will guide,<br />
That I the Name of <i>Maid</i> may lay aside.<br /><br /></td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I've beheld an am'rous Youth make Love,<br />
And swearing Truth by all the Gods above,<br />
How has it strait inflam'd my sprightly Blood<br />
Creating Flames, I scarcely should withstood,<br />
But bid him boldly march, not grant me leisure<br />
Of Parley, for 'tis Speed augments the Pleasure.<br />
Sirrah! tis my Misfortune not to meet<br />
With any Man that would my Passion greet,<br />
If he with balmy Kisses stop'd my Breath,<br />
From which one cannot die a better Death,<br />
Or stroke my Breasts, those Mountains of Delight,<br />
Your very Touch would fire an Anchorite;<br />
Next let your wanton Palm a little stray,<br />
And dip thy Fingers in the milky way:<br />
Then having raiz'd me, let me gently fall,<br />
Love's Trumpets sound, so Mortal have at all.<br />
But why wish I this Bliss? I wish in vain,<br />
And of my plaguy Burthen do complain;<br />
For sooner may I see whole Nations dead,<br />
But I find one to get my Maiden-head.<br /><br /></td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;She that her Maiden-head does keep, runs through<br />
More Plagues than all the Land of <i>Egypt</i> knew;<br />
A teazing Whore, or a more tedious Wife,<br />
Plagues not a Marry'd Man's unhappy Life,<br />
As much as it do's me to be a Maid,<br />
Of which same Name I am so much afraid,<br />
Because I've often heard some People tell,<br />
They that die Maids, must all lead Apes in Hell;<br />
And so 'twere better I had never been,<br />
Than thus to be perplex'd: <i>God save the Queen.</i><br /><br /></td></tr>

When in mighty Storm a Ship is toss'd,<br />
And all do ask, What do's the Captain say?<br />
How they (poor Souls) bemoan themselves as lost,<br />
When his Advice at last is only, Pray!<br />
So as it was one Day my pleasing Chance,<br />
To meet a handsome young Man in a Grove,<br />
Both time and place conspir'd to advance<br />
The innocent Designs of charming Love.<br />
I thought my Happiness was then compleat,<br />
Because 'twas in his Pow'r to make it so;<br />
I ask'd the Spark if he would do the Feat,<br />
But the unperforming Blockhead answer'd, <i>No</i>.<br />
Poor Prisoners may, I see, have Mercy shewn,<br />
And Shipwreck'd Men may sometimes have the Luck,<br />
To see their dismal Tempests overblown,<br />
But I poor Virgin never shall be F----.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Cursing the grievous Rigor of my Fate,<br />

I dream I'm mingling with some Man my Thigh,<br />
Till something more than ord'nary does rise;<br />
But when I wake and find my Dream's in vain,<br />
I turn to Sleep only to Dream again,<br />
For Dreams as yet are only kind to me,<br />
And at the present quench my Lechery.<br /><br /></td></tr>

For I look like Death, and am as weak as Water,<br />
For several Days I loath the sight of Meat,<br />
And every Night I chew the upper Sheet;<br />
[*?]e such Obstructions, that I'm almost moap'd,<br />
And breath as if my Vitals all were stop'd.<br />
I told a Friend how strange with me it was,<br />
She, an experienc'd Bawd, soon grop'd the Cause,<br />
Saying, <i>for this Disease, take what you can,<br />
You'll ne'er be well, till you have taken Man.</i><br />
Therefore, before with Maiden-heads I'll be<br />
Thus plagu'd, and live in daily Misery,<br />

Nay any thing indeed, would be poor I,<br />
N'er Maiden-heads upon my Hands should lie,<br />
Which till I lose, I'm sure my watry Eyes<br />
Will pay to Love so great a Sacrifice,<br />
That my Carcass soon will weep out all its Juice,<br />

By all the Twines and Circles of the Night,<br />
By the first Minute of those Nuptial Joys,<br />
When Men put fairly for a Brace of Boys,<br />
Dying a Virgin once I more do dread,<br />
Than ten times losing of a <i>Maiden head</i>;<br />
For tho' it can't be seen nor understood,<br />
Yet is it troublesome to Flesh and Blood.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Unwounded yet, have scop'd the fatal Darts;<br />
Let the sad Fate of a poor Virgin move,<br />
And learn by me to pay Respect to Love.<br />
If one can find a Man fit for Love's Game,<br />
To lose one's Maiden-head it is no Shame:<br />
'Tis no Offence, if from his tender Lip<br />
I snatch a tonguing Kiss; if my fond Clip<br />
With loose Embraces oft his Neck surround,<br />
For Love in Debts of Nature's ever bound.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Nor have I Ease, but when returning Night,<br />
With Sleep's soft gentle Spell my Senses charms,<br />
Then Fancy some Gallant brings to my Arms:<br />
In them I oft the lov'd Shadow seem<br />
To grasp, and Joys, yet blush I too in Dream.<br />
I wake, and long my Heart in Wonder lies,<br />
To think on my late pleasing Extasies:<br />
But when I'm waking, and don't yet possess,<br />
In Sleep again I wish to enjoy the Bliss:<br />
For Sleep do's no malicious Spies admit,<br />
Yet yields a lively Semblance of Delight.<br />
Gods! what a Scene of Joy was that! how fast<br />
I clasp'd the Vision to my panting Breast?<br />
With what fierce Bounds I sprung to meet the Bliss,<br />
While my wrapt Soul flew out in ev'ry Kiss!<br />
Till breathless, faint, and softly sunk away,<br />
I all dissolv'd in reaking Pleasures lay.<br /><br /></td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Happen what will, I'll make some Lovers know<br />
What Pains, what raging Pains I undergo,<br />
Till I am really Heart-sick, almost Dead,<br />
By keeping that damn'd thing a Maiden-head.<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
